@segmentation @sequence

Feature: Segmentation of document sequence

  Examples:

  Scenario Outline: Get parts of sequence
    Given an xml file "segmentation_short.xml"
    And a sequence with the following identifier and timeBase
      | sequence_identifier | time_base |
      | test                | media     |
    When we create a new document with the following template variables
      | body_dur | span1_begin | span1_end | span2_begin | span2_end |
      | 00:00:05 | 00:00:01    | 00:00:02  | 00:00:03    | 00:00:04  |
    And body begins at <body1_begin>
    And document added to the sequence
    When we create a new document with the following template variables
      | body_dur | span1_begin | span1_end | span2_begin | span2_end |
      | 00:00:05 | 00:00:01    | 00:00:02  | 00:00:03    | 00:00:04  |
    And body begins at <body2_begin>
    And document added to the sequence
    When we create a new document with the following template variables
      | body_dur | span1_begin | span1_end | span2_begin | span2_end |
      | 00:00:05 | 00:00:01    | 00:00:02  | 00:00:03    | 00:00:04  |
    And body begins at <body3_begin>
    And document added to the sequence
    And the sequence is segmented from <range_from> to <range_to>
    Then the fragment contains body with computed times from <frag_body_begin> to <frag_body_end>
    And the fragment only contains styles <frag_styles>
    And the fragment only contains regions <frag_regions>


    Examples:
    | body1_begin | body2_begin | body3_begin | range_from | range_to | frag_body_begin | frag_body_end | frag_styles                                                                                                         | frag_regions                             |
